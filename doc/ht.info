File: ht.info,  Node: Configuration files,  Prev: Features,  Up: Features

Configuration files
===================

Global configuration
--------------------

   HT automatically creates a file to store its configuration.  It is
called `~/.htcfg' on Unices and `ht.cfg' (where ht.exe resides) on
Windows. More specifically it contains HT's registry and the *Note
Global history::.

Per file configuration
----------------------

   The analyser (for analysable files) will be stored in an extra file
called `FILENAME.htcfg', where FILENAME is the analysed file. This file
contains all information to restore the complete state of the analyser.


File: ht.info,  Node: Clipboard,  Prev: Features,  Up: Features

Clipboard
=========

   All open files and dialogs use the common clipboard, where all
copied and cut text or binary data is stored. Clipboard operations are
normally binary safe, that means you can copy some binary data out of a
file and paste it into an input line. Exceptions are only the \0
character (binary null), it will be converted to a space in places
where it would not make sense (e.g. file open).

   Although the clipboard won't be saved between different HT sessions
(ie. you will loose it when exiting HT), you can either save and load it
or part of it manually (via Edit->paste into/copy from file) or rely on
the input lines' *Note history: Global history, which is stored and
retrieved from the config file automatically.


File: ht.info,  Node: Global history,  Prev: Features,  Up: Features

Global history
==============

   HTs history system is global, which means that you can use it for
all open files. Histories are also grouped by their context. I.e.
file-related and regex-search-related dialogs have their own history
(who would want to open "[0-9][0-9a-z]+" anyway ?).

   History entries are stored within the *Note Configuration files::,
so they can be reused when you relaunch.

   You can delete a history entry by pressing DEL inside the history
popup.


File: ht.info,  Node: Expression evaluation,  Prev: Features,  Up: Features

Expression evaluation
=====================

   HT contains a very powerful expression evaluator which is used in
all dialogs where expressions are expected. These are mainly
blockoperation, goto, search and of course evaluate itself
(Edit->Evaluate).

   You can use all standard math operators (+ - / * % **), logical
operators (! && || ^^), relational operators (== != < > <= >=), bit
operators (~ & | ^), string operators (. for concatenation),
parenthesis, the ternary operator (a?b:c), functions and symbols (both
depending on context).

   The evaluator uses integer, string and float types depending on
context. You can always convert a result via the `int()', `string()'
and `float()' functions to appropriate type. Try Edit->Evaluate to see
how it works...

Functions and symbols
---------------------

   You can always use the standard built-in math (`round', `sin',
`random', etc.) and string (`strcmp', `strchr', `sprintf', etc.)
functions, they work more or less like the corresponding C functions
(actually they ARE more or less wrappers for them); see `eval/eval.y'
for details (sorry but a detailed help would get outdated rather soon).
When using *Note Block operations::, or searching you have some context
depending functions and symbols; see these sections for explanation.


File: ht.info,  Node: Block operations,  Prev: Features,  Up: Features

Block operations
================

   Block operation (Blockop) is a very powerful tool to perform
modifications on binary files. It is available in hex viewer only.

   Blockop takes four parameters: START, END, MODE and EXPRESSION.
Blockop works as follows:

   * START: Start at the offset specified by START

   * REPEAT: Evaluate EXPRESSION and store n bytes (1 - byte, 2 - word,
     4 - dword, variable - string) at the current offset. Increment
     current offset by n. Stop if END has been reached.

Special variables/functions that can be used in EXPRESSION:

`readbyte(ofs)'
     read a byte from offset OFS, returns a number

`readstring(ofs, size)'
     read SIZE bytes from offset OFS, returns a string

`i'
     contains the iteration count/index starting with 0

`o'
     contains the current offset


File: ht.info,  Node: Search and its different modes,  Prev: Features,  Up: Features

Search and its different modes
==============================

   The search function is one of the most advanced functions of HT.  It
is invoked through F7, Shift-F7 continues a search from cursor.
Depending on context (ie. file type and mode) the following modes are
enabled:

bin: ASCII / Hex
----------------

   Enter an exact search string either via ascii characters or via
hexadecimal interpretation. This is the fastest search mode. You may
specify a case-insensitive search.

bin: eval str
-------------

   Enter an expression, it will be evaluated ONCE (difference to the
4th mode), and HT will then search for the result-string. This is
pretty useful when searching for intermixed text and
control-chars/binary, e.g. `"hello world\n\0"'

display: regex
--------------

   As the prefix indicates, this search doesn't search in the binary
file but in the display on screen. HT searches for a regular expression
so this can be very powerful, e.g. in PE/Image you can search for
`(add|sub).+?,\ [78]$'.  This will find all add or sub instructions
with second parameter 7 or 8.

expr nonzero
------------

   This is the slowest but also most advanced search mode. Enter an
expression and the search stops if this expression evaluates to
non-zero (it will be evaluated on every byte). In this mode there are
two predefined symbols and some functions: I is always the number of
current iteration and O stands for the current offset in file. With the
functions `readbyte(ofs)' and `readstring(ofs, size)' you access the
file's content.

   It's easier to understand this with examples:

  1. Searching for patterns:

       a. Enter `readbyte(o) == readbyte(o+1)'
          This will search for two equal bytes ("AA", "55", "!!", etc.).

       b. Enter `(readbyte(o) == readbyte(o+1)+1) &&
          ((readbyte(o)==readbyte(o+2)+2)'
          This will search for three ascending bytes ("ABC", "123",
          etc).

  2. Search with special functions:

     With HT you can easily detect the RSA key in the `ADVAPI32.DLL':
     Search for `entropy(readstring(o, 64)) > 82' in expr!=0 mode, and
     you will find it very quickly. How does it work? `readstring(o,
     64)' reads a 64 byte string from current offset and entropy
     calculates the entropy ("randomness") of a string (result is
     0..100).  So the search stops if a entropy greater than 82%
     (guessed value) is encountered, which normally indicates packed or
     encryted data.

     Note: the `entropy()' function is not the best of its kind, if you
     know of a better one please let us know!
